Dear California residents

Roads and highways allow us to cross this Golden State, perform our work, meet our family and friends, and find beautiful views that make us want to call California home. But what you should remember when you make it before you drive is that you should follow road rules with safety as your top priority, do not neglect your caution when driving, and refrain from drunk driving.

In California, we should never forget that issuing a driver's license is a privilege with great responsibility, given that 2,600 and a half drivers with licenses share the road together. It is important to read this California Driver's Guide carefully in order to fully understand all the obligations that each of us has to comply with. This guide is also conveniently available online at www.dmv.ca.gov or by downloading an "app" that provides sample quizzes, training videos and interactive tutorials.

While new automotive technologies to improve reliability when driving are constantly being fitted to cars and frameworks, it is still up to us to keep an eye on the road, hold the steering wheel by hand and focus on driving. You should also be vigilant against cyclists and pedestrians at all times.

I wish you a safe driving.
