Dear fellow Californian,
Whether you’re an experienced driver who has been behind the wheel for decades or a teenager receiving your provisional permit, the California Department of Motor Vehicles is committed to ensuring that every person with a driver license understands the rules of road and practices safe driving habits.

There are more than 27 million licensed drivers in our great state, and our goal is for all of them – as well as pedestrians and bicyclists who share the road – to return home safely each day. This California Driver Handbook is a guide for drivers of expectations and responsibilities.

As Californians renew or obtain a new driver license this year, they have the option to apply for a federally-compliant “REAL ID” card. A DMV REAL ID card, or other federally approved identification, will be required to board a domestic flight beginning October 1, 2020. The DMV website explains the benefits and requirements of a REAL ID, including documents required to apply, we hope these printable documents will help expedite your office visit.

DMV is improving customer service by updating the resources available online. By visiting dmv.ca.gov, you can access a digital copy of this handbook as well as practice exams, frequently asked questions and other material to educate and enhance your driving ability. Because no matter if you’re a veteran driver or a novice, we all benefit from good driving habits.
Wishing you safe journeys,
