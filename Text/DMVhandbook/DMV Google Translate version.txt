Dear California Residents

Roads and highways traverse the Golden State to do business, meet family and friends, and discover the beautiful scenery that makes California home. But before you drive, remember that you must put safety first, obey the rules of the road, stay alert while driving, and refrain from driving under the influence of alcohol.

With 2,600 licensed drivers sharing the roads in California, we must never forget that issuing a driver's license is a privilege that comes with great responsibility. It is important that you read this California Driver's Handbook to fully understand all of the obligations that each of us has. This guide is also conveniently available online at www.dmv.ca.gov or as a downloadable “app” that provides sample quizzes, educational videos and interactive tutorials.

Cars and trucks are constantly being equipped with new automotive technologies to improve safety while driving, but it is still up to us to keep our eyes on the road, put our hands behind the wheel and focus on driving. You must also remain vigilant for bicyclists and pedestrians at all times.

We wish you safe driving.
