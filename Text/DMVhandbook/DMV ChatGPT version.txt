To California residents,

As we traverse this Golden State through roads and highways, we can discover the breathtaking landscapes that make us call California our home. We conduct our business, meet our families and friends, and find joy in the beauty that surrounds us. However, before you embark on your journey, it is crucial to remember to prioritize safety, adhere to traffic rules, stay focused while driving, and abstain from drunk driving.

In California, we share the roads with over 26.5 million licensed drivers. Therefore, obtaining a driver's license is not only a privilege but also a great responsibility that should never be forgotten. To fully comprehend all the obligations we must uphold, it is important to thoroughly read the California Driver Handbook. This handbook is also available online at www.dmv.ca.gov, where you can conveniently access samples quizzes, educational videos, and interactive tutorials through the provided "app."

While new automotive technologies are continuously being integrated into cars and trucks to enhance safety, it is still our duty to remain attentive to the road, hold the steering wheel with our hands, and focus on driving. Additionally, we must always be mindful of bicyclists and pedestrians and never overlook their presence.

We wish you safe driving at all times.
