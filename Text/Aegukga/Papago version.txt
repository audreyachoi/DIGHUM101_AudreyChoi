1. Until the East Sea and Baekdusan Mountain dry out and wear out, God bless our country.

2. The wind and frost are invariable as if they were wrapped in pine ironclad on Namsan Mountain.

3. The autumn sky is empty, high and without clouds, and the bright moon is one heart of our hearts.

4. Loyalty with this spirit and this heart, love the country, even if it is painful or enjoyable.

Chorus: Mugunghwa Samchully Flamboyant Gangsan. Let us preserve the road with respect to the people of great importance.
