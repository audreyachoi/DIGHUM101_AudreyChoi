1. Until that day when the waters of the East Sea run dry and Mount Baekdusan is worn away, God protect and preserve our nation; Hurray to Korea.

2. As the pine atop the near mountain stands firm, unchanged through wind and frost, as if wrapped in armor, so shall our resilient spirit.

3. The autumn sky is void and vast, high and cloudless; the bright moon is our heart, undivided and true.

4. With this spirit and this mind, give all loyalty, in suffering or in joy, to the love of country.

Refrain: Three thousand ri of splendid rivers and mountains covered with mugunghwa blossoms. Great Korean people, stay true to the Great Korean way!
