1. Until the East Sea's waters and Mount Baekdu are dry and worn,
May God protect and preserve our country forever.


2. Like the pine tree on Namsan, standing firm with its iron-like bark,
May our spirit be unchanging amidst the harsh winds and frost.


3. The autumn sky is high and wide, with no clouds in sight,
The bright moon shines, reflecting our unwavering hearts.


4. With this spirit and devotion, let us serve with loyalty,
Through both hardship and joy, let us love our country.

chorus: May the three thousand ri of splendid rivers and mountains be forever glorious,
May the Korean people, devoted to Korea, prosper forever.
