1. Until the waters of the East Sea and Mt.

2. As if the iron armor of that pine tree was wrapped around Namsan, the invariance of wind and frost is our spirit.

3. The autumn sky is open, but high and cloudless, the bright moon is single in our hearts.

4. Loyalty with this spirit and this heart, love the country whether it is painful or happy.

Refrain: Mugunghwa Samcheonri Hwaryeongangsan. Let's preserve the length of the people of Daehan.
