1. As the East Sea's waters and Mount Baekdu wither and wear away, May God protect and preserve our country forever.

2. Like the pine tree atop Namsan, standing firm against the wind and frost, Our spirit is unchanging.

3. The autumn sky is vast and clear, without a single cloud, The bright moon shines upon our devoted hearts.

4. With this spirit and devotion, through both hardships and joys, Let us love our country.

Chorus: May the three thousand ri of splendid rivers and mountains, Protect our nation, the Korean people.
