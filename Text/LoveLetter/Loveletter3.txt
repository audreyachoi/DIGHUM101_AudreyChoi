Every time I see you smile or laugh or just acting goofy, it makes me proud to be your husband, and it always makes my day so much fun! Also, when you are with the kids, I see that they are proud of their mom because she is so much fun, so smart, and so loving! When I put all of this together, the best of life is with you, and the kids and I are so glad that you belong to us! We love you very much!
