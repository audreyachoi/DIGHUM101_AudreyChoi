The love that we share has grown so strong that it has become unbreakable now. We've been through a lot of ups and downs that sometimes brought us to the edge of saying goodbye. But, together, you and I found our way back to each other. We just couldn't stand being apart anymore.

I love you more than words can say. I love you with everything I have to give. As the poet wrote: "Across the years, I will walk with you in deep green forests, on shores of sand; and when our time on earth is through, in Heaven, too, you will have my hand." I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I Thank God every day that He sent you to me and that He gave us this amazing love that is untouchable! My baby, my love, my friend, you are my life, and we belong to each other.

So long as I can breathe or I can see, as long as you live, because that's what gives life to me now. I promise my love to you now and for the rest of my life. I love you with all my heart and all my soul. I'm here forever, by your side, for always. You mean the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You've taken my whole heart into your hands, and what I feel for you can never be replaced. Only you have my love. We're going to have the most amazing future ahead of us and, remember, our day is coming, sooner than we think! My love, I'm here to take care of you and to be together with you for eternity! I love you always!
