It's so hard to believe that in just six days we will have been together for a year now! Time really does fly when you are having the time of your life, doesn't it? At times I wish we could go back and relive the whole relationship, don't you? Although we both made our share of mistakes, I wouldn't change one thing; not a single breath spent with you would be different.

You are the greatest gift the world has ever presented to me. I have to admit that a year ago I didn't believe in God, or even any higher power for that matter, but now that I have you, you are my angel God has sent down to watch over me. You are my heart and my soul. You are everything to me. I love you with every ounce of my heart and soul, and so much more. Words cannot explain how much you mean to me, and I am truly blessed to have you in my life.

This year has turned out to be so amazing. I want to thank you for making my life worthwhile. You are my heart, my soul, my everything. I never want to be without you. I love you so much!
