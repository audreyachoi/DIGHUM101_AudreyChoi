My one love,

After all these years we've been together, my heart still flutters when you walk into the room. In my eyes, you grow more attractive with each passing year. Everyone told us passion eventually fades when two people spend a lifetime with each other, but that's not true for us, is it? I want you as much today as I did when our love was new, and everything you do shows me you feel the same way about me.

I only have to look at you, and that touch of gray at your temple makes me want to press my lips there and feel your pulse begin to beat a little faster. I want to leave a trail of soft kisses across your cheek until I reach your full, perfect lips. I want to kiss those lips so deeply it takes your breath away and thrills you with promises of pleasures to come. For now, you can imagine what those pleasures might be, and tonight, I'll fulfill those promises.

Anticipating a romantic evening,
