I don't know where to start to tell you all the incredible things my heart is feeling. I don't want my letter to say all the usual things someone will say when they're in love. I am just so happy to finally find someone who truly loves me, who really cares, and not just another person who comes into my life to play with my heart for a little while, and then leave. I want to thank you for being my friend. You mean everything to me. I want to tell you I love you, and I want to make you happy always. Thank you for giving me what no one has ever been able to give me before--you!
