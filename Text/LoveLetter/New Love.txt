My Dear,

I never knew how joyful life could be until I saw your face. My heart leaps in my chest every time I see you, and I have to say, I've never had this feeling with anyone before.

When I think about you and our rich conversations, I feel a warmness inside. It feels like we can talk about anything, even though we haven't known each other for that long. Our connection is profound to me. Every time I think about you, especially the way you look so lovely when you laugh, I can't hide my smile. Thinking about you makes me so happy, even when we are apart.

People keep asking what happened to create this new and better me. They wonder why I'm smiling more. I tell them, without hesitation, it is you.

Sometimes I feel like my heart will burst with all the longing and excitement I feel when I think of you. Looking forward to seeing you soon.

With so much joy because of you,
