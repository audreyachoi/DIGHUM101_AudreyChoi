My Sweet,

At night, I lie down and imagine you are here with me. I didn't know just how heavy this separation would be in my heart. I hope you are not in as much utter misery as I am without you. You've become essential somehow; I feel like a piece of me is missing when we're not together.

It's not just your body I miss (though, yeah, I do miss that a lot). It's just everything. I didn't realize how many things reminded me of you until now. I look around and see signs of you everywhere - that little place we had dinner the other day, the theater where you jumped in the scary parts of the movie. I laugh less with you gone too; your humor and perspective on life are so wonderful.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I just really miss you. Until I can see you and hold you again, you will remain omnipresent in my dreams.

Yours,
