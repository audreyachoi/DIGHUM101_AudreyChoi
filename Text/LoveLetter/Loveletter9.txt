It's hard to explain just how much I love you. You do things for me I never knew were possible. With each look, with each kiss, with each embrace, you make me feel more alive and special.

It's so much of an understatement to say I'm glad that you are mine! Since we've been together, an appreciation for the possibilities and joys of living have arisen in me, and I can never really thank you enough for that. You have refreshed my most precious possession--my heart. Through your love, you have opened my eyes to the wonders all around me. I can't truly thank you enough for this gift, but please know that I will never give you a reason to say that I don't care about you. There is not a second that you're not in my mind. I will always be there for you, and I will always love you.
