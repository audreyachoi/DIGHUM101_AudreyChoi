I am so glad to be loved by someone as special as you are. I thought for a long time that nobody could ever make me happy and win my hardened heart until I met you. You've really changed my life and I thank God I am loved and cherished by someone like you. You brought a sweet love into my life.

I love you so much. You mean more than anything in this world to me. I thank God I found you, and I will do my best to keep your sweet love in my life.
